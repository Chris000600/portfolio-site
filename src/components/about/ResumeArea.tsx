                  <p>
                    At Vidio, I worked as a Sr. Data Analyst and Business
                    Intelligence Analyst, focusing on social media performance,
                    ad optimization, and workflow improvements. I analyzed KOL
                    campaigns, created post-campaign reports, and increased data
                    accuracy from 62% to ~100%. I also built predictive growth
                    models with 85%+ accuracy, improved ad targeting, and made
                    reporting over 10x faster. My role involved working across
                    teams to improve data-driven decision-making and streamline
                    daily operations.

                  <p>
                    I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from The University of
                    Western Australia, where I built a strong foundation in AI,
                    data analysis, cybersecurity, and systems programming. My
                    studies covered a range of topics, including algorithms,
                    database management, and computer networks, giving me a
                    well-rounded technical skill set. I also gained hands-on
                    experience in software development, web architecture, and
                    business strategy, applying my knowledge to real-world
                    projects. During my time there, I led a team project
                    integrating Googleâ€™s API into an automated booking system,
                    which placed 2nd out of 250 for execution and innovation.

                    At Artisse AI, I worked as an AI Analyst & Project Manager,
                    focusing on AI optimization, business development, and
                    workflow automation. I curated AI training datasets,
                    improving model accuracy and introducing new VTO features. I
                    also led B2B outreach, securing partnerships with Microsoft
                    Teams and Samsung Galaxy AI. Additionally, I managed legal
                    entity setups across multiple countries and oversaw HR
                    recruitment, interviewing over 200 candidates for key roles.
                    My work streamlined AI processes, business operations, and
                    corporate expansion efforts.

                    I attended The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in
                    2018, studying B.E. in Systems Engineering and Engineering
                    Management. My coursework covered advanced mathematics, data
                    visualization, systems programming, and robotics
                    engineering, providing a strong technical foundation. Due to
                    the Hong Kong riots, I left in December 2019 and later
                    transferred to The University of Western Australia to
                    complete my studies.
